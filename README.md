> Building software and exploring Web3 technologies.

A fullstack web developer with a growing interest in Web3 technologies. I'm exploring decentralized applications, blockchain, and the next generation of the internet. Through continuous learning and hands-on projects, I'm excited to contribute to the evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and tokenized assets.
