# I'm Lou1s

> Building software and exploring Web3 technologies.

Hey, I'm Lou1s — a fullstack web developer with a growing obsession for Web3.

Back in my second year of college, I somehow turned late-night coding, caffeine, and curiosity into almost $20,000 — through hackathons, bounties, grants, and outsourcing gigs. No fancy setup, just me, my laptop, and a borderline unhealthy relationship with the terminal.

What started as "lemme try this" quickly became "ok wait this is kinda fire." Now I'm neck-deep in decentralized apps, smart contracts, and the wild world of tokenized assets.

Still learning, still shipping, still chasing that next aha moment.
